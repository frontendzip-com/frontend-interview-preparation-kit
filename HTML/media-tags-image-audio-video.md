## Media Tags in HTML: Embedding Images, Audio, and Video

HTML provides dedicated tags for embedding multimedia content like images, audio, and video into your webpages. These tags allow you to display rich media content, enhancing the user experience and making your webpages more engaging.

**1. Image Tag (`<img>`)**

The `<img>` tag is the workhorse for embedding images within your HTML. Here's a basic syntax:

```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Image description">
```

* **`src`**: Required attribute specifying the path to the image file (relative or absolute URL).
* **`alt`**:  **Essential attribute** providing alternative text for the image. This text is displayed if the image cannot be loaded or for visually impaired users relying on screen readers. It also improves SEO by providing context to search engines.

**Additional Attributes:**

* **`width` and `height`**: Define the image dimensions in pixels.
* **`title`**: Optional attribute for providing additional tooltip text displayed on hover.

**2. Audio Tag (`<audio>`)**

The `<audio>` tag allows you to embed audio files on your webpage. Here's an example:

```html
<audio controls>
  <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
```

* **`controls`**:  Optional attribute adding playback controls (play, pause, volume) to the audio player.
* **`<source>`**:  This tag specifies the source of the audio file. You can include multiple `<source>` tags with different file formats to ensure wider browser compatibility.
  * **`src`**: Attribute specifying the path to the audio file.
  * **`type`**: Attribute defining the audio file format (e.g., "audio/mpeg" for MP3).

**3. Video Tag (`<video>`)**

The `<video>` tag is used for embedding video content. Here's a basic structure:

```html
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video element.
</video>
```

This structure is similar to the `<audio>` tag, with the addition of width and height attributes for defining the video dimensions. 

**Key Points:**

* Always consider accessibility by providing alternative text for images and captions for audio/video.
* Use appropriate file formats considering factors like quality, file size, and browser compatibility.
* Explore additional attributes like `autoplay`, `loop`, and `poster` (for displaying an image before the video plays) for more control over media playback.

By effectively using these media tags, you can add multimedia elements to your webpages, creating a richer and more interactive user experience.
